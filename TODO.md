# TODO / Roadmap

Tracks phase status for devialet-expert-remote-widget. See CLAUDE.md for
architecture decisions; this file is just sequencing and status.

## Done

- [x] **Phase 1 — protocol + daemon + CLI scaffold.** Cargo workspace,
      28/28 protocol tests passing, clippy clean. Verified live: daemon
      receives/parses real UDP status broadcasts, devialet-ctl controls
      source/power/volume/mute against the real amp, D-Bus
      PropertiesChanged confirmed firing via busctl.
- [x] **Phase 2 — minimal working tray plasmoid.** Plasma 6 system tray
      icon + flyout, live-updating volume display bound to the daemon's
      D-Bus properties, one working command (-1dB button) round-tripped
      against the real amp. No styling, no other controls yet.
- [x] **Phase 2.5 — cleanup.**
  - devialet-ctl resolved via PATH instead of a hardcoded dev-machine
    path (executable engine invokes via `/bin/sh -c`, so shell PATH
    resolution applies — documented in CLAUDE.md + README).
  - D-Bus reactivity claim corrected from "documented upstream
    limitation" to explicitly-labeled inference (no matching report
    found on a bounded search); imperative `onPropertiesChanged`
    workaround unaffected.
- [x] **Phase 3 — full functional controls, default styling.** Volume
      slider + step buttons, mute toggle, power toggle, source picker —
      all bound to real D-Bus properties, all confirmed round-tripping
      against the real amp (both via my own `busctl`/`devialet-ctl`
      checks and your real-tray clicks). No copper/graphite theming, no
      amp picker, no settings view yet.
  - Debounce ported directly from MainActivity.kt (verified against that
    source, not reconstructed from memory): button steps use a sliding
    400ms window (each step resets the timer); the slider only sends +
    stamps its timestamp once, on release; a separate `volumeInteracting`
    flag blocks all incoming volume pushes for the whole duration of an
    active drag or button-hold, independent of the timestamps. Mute/
    Power/Source get a single-shot 400ms window too (not in the Kotlin
    app, but explicitly requested for consistency - a deliberate
    addition, not silent parity drift).
  - Volume range: -15dB ceiling is code-enforced (`MAX_VOLUME_DB` in the
    protocol crate); -60dB floor is a UI convention only (matches the
    Kotlin app's own slider bounds) - **not** enforced anywhere in Rust.
  - Confirmed by reading devialet-ctl's source: the forced -40dB
    post-source-switch volume is already handled inside `devialet-ctl
    source`, not something QML needs to send separately.
  - Volume label bug: the display was bound to `root.volumeDb` (only
    updated on release) instead of the slider's own live `value`, so it
    stayed static during a drag. Fixed by binding the label to
    `volumeSlider.value` directly, which tracks the drag continuously
    regardless of when the actual send happens.
  - Source ComboBox saga, root-caused with wire-level evidence rather
    than left as an unsubstantiated workaround:
    1. Popup wouldn't open at all inside `PlasmoidItem`'s
       fullRepresentation (real tray only, not `plasmawindowed`). Fixed
       by switching to `org.kde.plasma.components.ComboBox`, grounded in
       real evidence: no installed plasmoid on this machine uses
       QtQuick.Controls' ComboBox inside its actual popup content (only
       in separate config dialogs), and PlasmaComponents3's own
       ComboBox.qml source contains an explicit comment + linked QTBUG
       acknowledging QQC2 Popup behaves incorrectly outside a genuine
       top-level Window.
    2. Regression after that fix: dropdown greyed out, popup still
       wouldn't open. Root-caused via `busctl monitor` independent of
       QML: the daemon emits `Sources` correctly on every single
       `PropertiesChanged` cycle (confirmed both from the wire, 60/600
       signals over 6s, and from the daemon's own source -
       `apply_and_emit()` has no equality check), but the signal's own
       delta payload becomes unusable client-side after the first
       delivery (confirmed via `JSON.stringify` showing a real array
       once, then a genuinely empty result every time after - not just
       inconsistently wrapped, unlike every scalar property). Matches a
       documented general QtDBus behavior (complex types inside a
       PropertiesChanged payload are left undemarshalled) - cited, not
       just asserted this time.
    3. Fix: on receiving a `PropertiesChanged` signal mentioning
       `Sources`, explicitly issue a fresh `org.freedesktop.DBus.
       Properties.Get` call via `Plasma::DBusConnection.asyncCall` and
       use that reply instead of trusting the signal's own payload -
       still fully push-driven, no polling. Two real API gotchas hit and
       fixed along the way (both confirmed by logging actual runtime
       shapes, not assumed): `DBusMessage`'s constructor needs the key
       `interface`, not the `iface` alias used everywhere else in this
       codebase; `asyncCall`'s resolve callback receives the whole
       `DBusPendingReply` object, needing `.value` on it.
    4. Verified at the wire level sustained over 15s in the real tray:
       98 explicit Get calls, all replies carrying the complete 30-entry
       array, zero malformed ones.
  - Final full four-control re-verification (post source-dropdown fix),
    confirmed independently via `busctl`/`devialet-ctl`: power on/off,
    mute on/off, volume set, and source switch (with forced -40dB) all
    round-trip correctly against the real amp.

- [x] **Phase 3.5 — multi-amp daemon support.** Daemon-only, no QML changes
      (Phase 4 builds the picker against this). Design proposed and
      confirmed before implementing (see CLAUDE.md's D-Bus service bullet
      for the settled shape) rather than silently picked.
  - `AmpState` (interface.rs) now tracks every amp ever heard broadcasting
    (`amps: HashMap<ip, TrackedAmp>`, never pruned) alongside an explicit
    `selected_ip` (`""` = none — ported from `MainActivity.selectedIp`'s
    SharedPreferences sentinel, confirmed by reading that source rather
    than guessing). Exposes it all on the *same* object/interface Phase 3's
    QML already binds to, not a replacement: `KnownAmps` (array of
    `(ip, device_name, online)`), `SelectedAmpIp`, `SelectAmp(ip)` method,
    alongside the existing primary properties (now driven by the selected/
    auto-selected amp instead of "whichever broadcast most recently").
  - Investigated (not assumed) how `devialet-ctl` targets an amp: it takes
    `--ip` explicitly per invocation and has zero daemon/D-Bus interaction
    — confirmed by reading its source. This phase's selection surface is
    therefore informational only until Phase 4's QML reads it and passes
    the IP to `devialet-ctl --ip` itself.
  - Auto-select-if-alone: with nothing explicitly selected and exactly one
    known amp, that amp drives the primary properties (avoids a
    "Not connected" regression before Phase 4's picker exists to call
    `SelectAmp`); with zero or 2+ known amps and nothing explicit, primary
    properties show the empty/not-connected state instead of guessing.
    Selection is in-memory only, not persisted across daemon restarts —
    deferred to Phase 4.
  - Protocol crate gained a public `fixtures::StatusFixtureBuilder`
    (promoted from a test-only private struct, now shared by the
    protocol crate's own tests too) so downstream crates can build
    realistic synthetic status packets without hand-rolling wire bytes.
  - **Automated tests** (8 new, `interface::tests`, all passing): two
    distinct synthetic amps built via `StatusFixtureBuilder` → real
    `parse_status` → `AmpState::ingest_status`, confirming they're tracked
    as separate `KnownAmps` entries (not overwritten), plus coverage of
    auto-select-if-alone, not-connected fallback with 2+ amps, explicit
    selection (known and unknown IPs), clearing back to `""`, and stable
    IP-sorted ordering. Full workspace: 36/36 tests, clippy clean.
  - **Live verification against real hardware + a synthetic second amp**
    (2026-08-22): added alias IP `192.168.0.222/24` on `eno1` (real amp at
    `192.168.0.134`'s subnet, real amp itself broadcasting from
    `192.168.0.22` as "My Devialet-ETH"). A throwaway test-sender (reused
    `devialet_protocol::fixtures`/`parse_status` wire format, not
    hand-rolled) broadcast a synthetic "SYNTH-TEST-AMP" from the alias IP
    at ~1s intervals. Confirmed via `busctl`: `KnownAmps` correctly showed
    both amps simultaneously by distinct IP; with nothing selected the
    primary properties correctly fell back to not-connected (2 known
    amps); `SelectAmp` round-tripped for both the synthetic and real amp
    IPs and for the `""` "None" clear, each confirmed via property reads
    and (for one case) a `busctl monitor` capture showing the actual
    `PropertiesChanged` signal firing on the wire. After stopping the
    synthetic broadcaster, confirmed (wire-level `busctl monitor` capture)
    that it flips to `online = false` in `KnownAmps` within one staleness
    tick (~1s) without being evicted — matches the deliberate "never
    prune" design — while the explicitly-selected real amp's own
    properties were unaffected. IP alias removed after testing and
    confirmed gone via `ip addr show dev eno1` (only the original
    `192.168.0.134/24` remains, no `secondary` entry left behind).
  - **Assumed, not verified:** behavior with three or more simultaneous
    amps (only two were feasible to test here — one real, one synthetic);
    the two-known-amps "not connected" fallback is exercised, but a
    three-way disambiguation UX (if one is ever needed beyond "explicit
    selection required") is unverified. Cross-daemon-restart behavior
    beyond "resets to no explicit selection" (i.e. real persistence) is
    unimplemented by design, not just untested — deferred to Phase 4.

## Up next

- [ ] **Phase 3.6 — systemd unit: create, enable, and verify.** Currently
      only manually started during dev/testing sessions — confirmed via
      a real reboot (2026-08-23) that nothing autostarts the daemon, so
      the widget silently shows "Not connected" on every login until it's
      started by hand. Create the `devialet-remote-daemon.service` unit
      already reserved in the repo layout, enable it
      (`systemctl --user enable`), and verify: reboot and confirm
      autostart works; kill the process and confirm systemd restarts it
      (Restart=on-failure); confirm `systemctl --user is-active` reports
      correctly for the QML settings toggle to eventually read.
- [ ] **Phase 4 — amp picker, settings view, full mockup styling.**
      Amp picker QML (built against whatever surface Phase 3.5 produces),
      Plasmoid.configuration settings view (blur, reduce motion, scroll
      step, launch-at-login display), copper/graphite theme, Space
      Grotesk/JetBrains Mono fonts, blur/animation, matching
      `devialet_tray_flyout_mockup.html`.
- [ ] **Phase 4.1 - scroll-over-tray-icon volume control.** When the
      mouse is hovering over the system tray icon for the widget, it
      should be possible to scroll using the mouse wheel to change the
      volume up/down depending on if the user is scrolling up or down.
- [ ] **Phase 4.2 - install script + devialet-ctl packaging story.**
      Bash install script (.sh) so a user can clone the repo, run it, and
      have the widget fully installed and usable — this necessarily
      includes deciding how devialet-ctl gets placed somewhere on PATH
      (currently a manual `~/.local/bin` symlink per README, fine for
      dev but not a real install path), alongside installing the
      plasmoid itself and the Phase 3.6 systemd unit. Treat this as one
      combined install story rather than a separate CLI-only packaging
      step, since the script would need to solve both anyway.

## Not yet scoped / parked



## Tasks to complete outside repo

- [ ] **Scroll-over-mpv-window volume control.** Separate MPV
      Lua script to redirect scroll events over active MPV windows to the 
      amp instead of MPV's own volume. Independent of the plasmoid itself 
      — not blocked on any of the phases above, can happen in parallel 
      whenever.
- [ ] **Add package to the AUR for easier install**
      Self-explanatory. The AUR (Arch User Repository) has packages
      uploaded by users of Arch / Arch-based distros (e.g. CachyOS).
      The devialet-expert-remote-widget would be nice to have uploaded
      there for easier install and sharing to other users.
