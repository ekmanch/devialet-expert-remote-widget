# Known Gotchas — Bug History

Every commit in this repo's history (26 total) that fixed a real bug, safety
issue, or UX-breaking race condition, found via `git log --oneline` +
`git show` on each candidate. Based on `main` @ `743aa71`. No automated tests
exist in this repo, so all of these were presumably caught by hand-testing
against a physical amp.

## 1. Volume jump/jerk after releasing VOL +/- buttons — [Control]

- **Symptom:** amp would report a different volume than the one the user
  actually stopped at when releasing the VOL - / VOL + button; the on-screen
  value visibly jumped/jerked right as the button was released.
- **Root cause:** the amp's own status broadcast (~1x/sec) can land *while* a
  volume change is in flight, still reporting the pre-change volume. The app
  was applying every incoming status broadcast unconditionally, so a
  stale/in-flight broadcast would momentarily overwrite the just-set value.
- **Fix:** added a debounce window (`volumeButtonDebounceMs`, repeat interval
  + 300ms buffer) after each button-driven volume step; incoming status
  broadcasts are ignored for that window so a stale broadcast can't stomp the
  just-sent value.
- **Commit:** `c80e329`
- **Watch out for this in Flutter:** any "optimistic local update, then
  reconcile against periodic device state" pattern needs a debounce/ignore
  window keyed off *when the local change was made*, not just a "user is
  actively dragging" flag — the race is between "I just sent X" and "I'm
  about to receive a broadcast describing pre-X state," which can happen even
  after the user has let go.

## 2. Same race, but for the volume dial/slider release (not the buttons) — [Control]

- **Symptom:** identical jump/jerk, but triggered by releasing the volume
  slider/dial drag rather than the step buttons.
- **Root cause:** identical race to #1 — releasing the slider sends the new
  volume, but an in-flight broadcast reporting the pre-release volume can
  land right after and snap the UI back before the *next* (correct) broadcast
  snaps it forward again.
- **Fix:** added a second debounce timestamp (`lastVolumeSliderReleaseAtMs`),
  reusing the same debounce window/constant as the button fix (#1) since it's
  the same underlying round-trip.
- **Commit:** `9f013b6`
- **Watch out for this in Flutter:** don't assume fixing this race for one
  input widget (buttons) also covers another (a drag gesture) — this codebase
  needed the same fix applied twice, once per input method. Any new
  volume-setting UI element (e.g. a second slider style, a hardware volume
  key passthrough) will need the same debounce treatment.

## 3. Wrong source selected — Optical 1 selection played Roon Ready instead — [Control]

- **Symptom:** selecting a source (e.g. tapping "Optical 1" in the UI) caused
  the amp to actually switch to a *different* source (e.g. "Roon Ready").
- **Root cause:** the command byte value for source selection was assumed to
  equal the source's index from the status broadcast (0–14), but the two are
  not the same — the amp's select-source command expects a different,
  non-linear value per source. The original code passed the raw status index
  straight through.
- **Fix:** introduced an explicit `SOURCE_COMMAND_VALUE` lookup table mapping
  status-broadcast index → command value for the known sources, with Phono
  handled as a separate hardcoded-byte special case (see below). Unmapped
  indices still fall back to passing the raw index through (unverified for
  those).
- **Commit:** `3aecc1a`
- **Watch out for this in Flutter:** **do not** assume the status-broadcast
  source index can be reused directly as the command value when
  reimplementing source selection — this table (and the Phono special case)
  must be ported byte-for-byte, not "cleaned up" or re-derived from a formula,
  since the underlying mapping is non-linear and only known empirically.

## 4. ACTIVE source in the UI didn't update after the user changed it — [Control]

- **Symptom:** after selecting a new source from the app, the UI kept showing
  the *previous* source as active until (presumably) the next broadcast
  eventually caught up, if it caught up correctly at all given bug #3 was in
  the same commit.
- **Root cause:** bundled into the same commit as #3 (this repo doesn't split
  logically-related fixes into separate commits) — the source-row rebuild
  logic in the UI only diffed on the *set of available source names*, not on
  which one was currently selected, so a pure selection change (no change to
  the list of sources) never triggered a re-render of which row shows as
  active.
- **Fix:** the rebuild "dirty" check was changed to key off `(name, isSelected)`
  pairs for every source, not names alone, so a selection-only change is
  correctly detected as needing a redraw. (Present in current code as the
  `tagKey` comparison in `MainActivity.rebuildSourceList()`; the code comment
  there explicitly explains the old bug: "Comparing names alone meant this
  always short-circuited after the first draw.")
- **Commit:** `3aecc1a`
- **Watch out for this in Flutter:** when diffing "should I rebuild this list"
  against incoming device state, make sure the diff key includes *selection
  state*, not just item identity/labels — a naive `list.map(name) == cached`
  check will miss selection-only changes exactly like this did.

## 5. Amplifier picked an inconsistent volume after switching sources — [Control]

- **Symptom:** switching inputs from the app left the amp at whatever volume
  it happened to remember for that input — inconsistent across sources
  (observed -40dB on Optical 1 vs -38dB on others), which read as broken/random
  behavior to the user even though it was actually just the amp's own
  per-input volume memory.
- **Root cause:** not a bug in this app's protocol handling per se — a
  quirk of the amp's own firmware behavior that the app hadn't compensated
  for.
- **Fix:** after every source switch, the app now unconditionally also sends
  a fixed `setVolumeDb(-40.0)` command, overriding whatever the amp would
  otherwise pick.
- **Commit:** `88d97eb`
- **Watch out for this in Flutter:** this is a deliberate **product decision
  masking a hardware quirk**, not a protocol requirement — must be explicitly
  carried over (source-select → forced volume, every time, no source
  exceptions) or the Flutter version will regress to the "random volume on
  input switch" complaint. Don't optimize this away as a redundant network
  call.

## 6. Dangerously loud volume reachable from the app (0dB was too loud) — [Control]

- **Symptom / risk:** the app allowed requesting up to 0dB, which was
  "dangerously loud" on the Expert Pro 140 — a real safety/hardware-damage and
  hearing-safety concern, not just a UX nit.
- **Root cause:** `setVolumeDb`'s safety clamp (`maxDb`) defaulted to `0.0`,
  and the UI's slider range matched it (0..60 steps mapping to -60..0 dB).
  The Devialet protocol itself supports up to +30dB — nothing at the protocol
  layer stops you from asking for a dangerous level.
- **Fix:** lowered the default safety clamp to **-15.0 dB** and correspondingly
  shrank the UI slider's range/labels to match, so the UI can't even present
  the option of going louder.
- **Commit:** `c6e2b63`
- **Watch out for this in Flutter:** **-15dB is a deliberate safety ceiling,
  not an arbitrary default** — carry it over exactly, at both layers (the
  network-layer clamp *and* the UI range), not just one. Don't "restore" the
  full -60..0 (or wider) range while porting UI polish without re-confirming
  the safety rationale with the user first. This is exactly the kind of thing
  that's easy to silently regress during a rewrite because it looks like a
  leftover/arbitrary constant.

## 7. Lint: touch-handling didn't call `performClick()`, breaking accessibility semantics — [Control]

- **Symptom:** Android Studio's Code Analysis lint flagged the VOL +/- button
  touch handling for not calling `performClick()`, which is the accessibility
  hook screen readers etc. rely on for custom touch handling.
- **Root cause:** volume repeat used a raw `setOnTouchListener` for
  press-and-hold behavior (added in `af9b927`, see the codebase's press-and-hold
  feature history) without also explicitly invoking `performClick()` on the
  matching `ACTION_UP`, since the touch listener fully replaced normal click
  handling.
- **Fix:** explicitly call `v.performClick()` on `ACTION_UP` from within the
  touch listener itself.
- **Commit:** `7990cf0`
- **Watch out for this in Flutter:** not directly portable (Flutter's gesture
  and semantics systems work differently from Android's `View.performClick()`
  contract) but the underlying lesson carries over — any custom
  press-and-hold/drag gesture implementation needs its own explicit
  accessibility semantics (Flutter's `Semantics`/`GestureDetector.onTap` etc.),
  since a fully custom low-level gesture handler bypasses the framework's
  default accessibility wiring the same way a raw `OnTouchListener` did here.

## 8. Post-boot status broadcast misreports the volume by 2 dB and does not self-correct — [Control]

- **Symptom:** right after the amp powers on, its status broadcast reports
  a volume 2 dB below what the amp is actually at (front panel), and keeps
  reporting it — the widget/app shows the wrong number indefinitely until
  it sends a volume command itself. This is the characterized form of the
  bug the KDE widget's TODO.md had tracked since Phase 4.3.1 as "widget
  doesn't reflect amp-initiated volume changes it didn't itself send",
  and the same symptom the Kotlin app showed.
- **Root cause:** amp firmware, not the client. Measured 2026-09-07 on
  the Expert Pro 140 (configurator startup volume -40 dB) with an
  independent raw UDP capture on port 45454 next to the daemon, 21+
  boots: the first `power_on` packet still carries the pre-shutdown byte
  (e.g. raw 145 = -25 dB); the next packet ~200 ms later carries **raw
  111 = -42.0 dB**, and every packet for the following 30 s stays at 111
  with no command in flight. The front panel read **-40** at the same
  moment. The daemon tracked every raw change within 1–40 ms, so nothing
  in the UDP → daemon → D-Bus path is dropping or lagging anything — the
  broadcast itself is wrong. It does not self-correct: only a volume
  command (any value) makes the broadcast track the real level again.
- **Fix:** none possible client-side for an externally-triggered
  power-on. The KDE widget's Phase 8.0.1 sends its configured startup
  volume ~500 ms after a *widget-initiated* boot confirms, which
  incidentally re-syncs the broadcast for that path only; a power-on
  from the physical remote or front panel stays exposed. See #9 for the
  timing constraint that send has to respect.
- **Watch out for this in Flutter:** do not "fix" a post-boot volume
  mismatch by re-reading status harder — the status *is* the wrong
  value. If the app needs a trustworthy post-boot volume, it has to set
  one (and see #9 for when that set is honored). Don't conflate this
  with #9: same amp-side event, two distinct consequences.

## 9. Volume commands that reach the amp before its own post-boot startup-volume application are dropped — [Control]

- **Symptom:** a volume command sent "right after the amp reports it is
  on" sometimes has no effect at all — not applied-then-overwritten, the
  status stream simply never carries the requested value; the amp stays
  at its own startup volume (misreported per #8).
- **Root cause:** the amp accepts a volume command only after it has
  applied its own configured startup volume, and that application's
  latency after the first `power_on` broadcast varies far more than a
  single control run suggests. Observed (raw capture, delay measured
  from the first raw `power_on` packet): application already done at
  or before the first On packet (3 boots), ~+200 ms (9 boots), +394 ms
  (1), and >+400 ms (3, where it surfaced only together with a +500 ms
  send). Whether the amp applies at a variable time, or a received
  command triggers the application once the amp is ready, could not be
  distinguished — the client doesn't need to know which.
- **Fix (KDE widget, Phase 8.0.1):** send the startup volume 500 ms
  after the boot confirms. Early-exit sweep, each cycle a full power
  off/on with a distinguishable target (-35, raw 125), pass = the raw
  stream shows the value within 2 s and still 6 s later:

  | send at (after first power_on packet) | passes |
  |---|---|
  | +2 ms | 0/1 — dropped, amp stayed at raw 111 for 30 s |
  | +100 ms | 1/2 — the failure had the amp's application at +394 ms |
  | +200 ms | 9/9 — but every pass had the application at ≤ +202 ms |
  | +500 ms | 3/3 — packets at +200/+400 still pre-application |
  | +1018 ms, +2030 ms | 1/1 each |

  500 ms is the smallest round value above the latest *observed*
  amp-side application (+394 ms), the mechanism behind the +100 ms
  failure; 200 ms passed 9/9 but sits inside the observed spread of that
  boundary rather than above it. The widget measures from the daemon's
  "On", which trails the raw packet by 1–40 ms, so its effective delay
  is slightly longer still. A user volume change made inside that
  window is honored by the amp (verified 4/4 at +161…+349 ms) — the
  widget then re-sends the user's value, not the configured one, so the
  user's action is never overridden.
- **Watch out for this in Flutter:** any "set volume after power-on"
  feature must wait for boot confirmation *and then some* — firing at
  the first on-broadcast is the worst case (0/1). Use the sweep above
  rather than re-measuring from scratch, and re-measure before shrinking
  the delay below 500 ms: the +200 ms figure is not a safety margin,
  it is the middle of the observed spread.

## Non-bugs worth knowing about (deliberate behavior, not defects)

- **No retry beyond a fixed double-send** (`sendTwice`) has existed since the
  initial commit and was never revisited as a "bug" — commands are just sent
  twice, no ack, no adaptive retry. Not a fix, but also not obviously robust;
  flagging in case the LAN conditions during Flutter development differ
  (e.g. Wi-Fi vs. the Ethernet-oriented use case implied by `usesCleartextTraffic`
  and general Devialet Ethernet-first design). **[Shared]** — applies to every
  command family, not just Control.
- **SAM / Night Mode / SAM level / Bass / Treble are permanently unimplemented**
  at the protocol layer as of `743aa71` — this isn't a regression to fix, it's
  a known gap (see `docs/protocol.md`, "Known-unimplemented commands"). Don't
  mistake the local-only UI toggles for working controls when testing the
  Flutter port against the current feature set. **[Sound]**
